# (Simple) Logging framework for java.
This logging framework is for the people who want a simple and pleasant experience with logging in the java language.
It's not meant to be advanced, just simple.

## Use
To be able to use the Logging Framework you need to initialize it like this.

```
Logger logger = new LoggerFactory().withName("name").withParenthesis(true|false).create();
```

## Features

It has these features, more to come.

```
logger.info(msg);
logger.print(msg);
logger.log(msg, level);
```

The level's are categorized in ranking and can be accessed.

## Use of this framework

Well, first you must read the `license`.
Also, ask me for permission to use it on discord. (Jay#2823).
